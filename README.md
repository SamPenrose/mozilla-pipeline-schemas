Telemetry Services
------------------

This repository contains schemas for Mozilla Firefox Telemetry pings.

These schemas are used to validate incoming submissions at ingestion time. The [RapidJSON](http://rapidjson.org/md_doc_schema.html) library is used for JSON Schema Validation.

To learn more about writing JSON Schemas, [Understanding JSON Schema](https://spacetelescope.github.io/understanding-json-schema/index.html) is a great resource.
