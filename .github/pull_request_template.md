Checklist for reviewer:

- [ ] Verify that the `integration` CI test has completed successfully;
      that test can't run automatically for forked PRs, so you may need to
      kick off tests locally or in CircleCI [as discussed in the README]
      (https://github.com/mozilla-services/mozilla-pipeline-schemas#packaging-and-integration-tests-optional)
