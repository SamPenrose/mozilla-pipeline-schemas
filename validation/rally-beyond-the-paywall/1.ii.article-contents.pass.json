      "textContent": "When California retires the color-coded tier system next week that it has used to set coronavirus regulations for most of the pandemic, six of the Bay Area’s nine counties will have reached its least-restrictive stage.\nAlameda and Napa counties found out Tuesday that they are advancing to the yellow stage that indicates “minimal” coronavirus spread in the state’s final update of tier assignments before most rules limiting business capacities and the size of gatherings are lifted June 15. They joined Santa Clara, San Mateo, San Francisco, Marin and Napa counties at that level.\nThe yellow tier’s looser rules, which include allowing bars that don’t serve food to operate indoors and higher capacity limits at businesses such as gyms and amusement parks, go into effect in Napa and Alameda counties Wednesday.\nContra Costa, Sonoma and Solano counties, meanwhile, will end the tier era in the orange stage, where the prevalence of COVID-19 is still considered “moderate.”\t\n“I’m happy to say goodbye to the tier system,” UC Berkeley professor emeritus Dr. John Swartzberg said, “but I think it served us well.”\n“No system would have made everybody happy,” Swartzberg added, “so I think we tried to find a system that kept people safe and at the same time allowed as much flexibility as we could have.”\nCalled the Blueprint for a Safer Economy, Gov. Gavin Newsom first rolled out the four-level reopening system last August, in the wake of a summer surge that scuttled a previous attempt to lift lockdown orders.\nIt grouped each of California’s 58 counties into tiers based on how prevalent the virus was locally, from the purple stage on the severe end signifying “widespread” COVID-19, to red, then orange and finally yellow. Classifications for most of the system’s tenure were based on three criteria: the rate of new coronavirus cases in a county, the overall test positivity rate and the positivity rate specifically within communities where the pandemic was taking a disproportionate toll.\nThe tiers allowed for more variation than the statewide lockdown orders by permitting certain higher-risk activities such as indoor dining in counties where the virus was less prevalent, while keeping them off-limits in other areas.\t\nIts requirement that counties slowly advance through tiers, spending at least three weeks at each level, also ensured restrictions weren’t lifted prematurely, Swartzberg said.\nBut the system also proved dizzyingly complex.\nIts rules were spelled out in a spreadsheet that delineated two-dozen types of businesses and activities — everything from restaurants to water parks, churches to offices — assigning each of them a set of specific protocols or capacity limits depending on the tier. The requirements for advancing could be hard to follow too.\n“It was very complicated — I could never remember exactly what to do,” Swartzberg said, although he concluded that was “a small price to pay for the flexibility that it gave us.”\nWhen COVID-19 exploded across California last winter, Newsom activated an “emergency brake” of regional lockdown orders more severe than the purple tier as the state scrambled to regain control during the worst chapter of the pandemic. Once the surge finally subsided early this year, counties once again began advancing through the tiers.\n\nWhen the blueprint ends on Tuesday, 24 counties, home to just over 25 million residents, will have made it to the yellow tier. San Diego, San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties joined Alameda and Napa in advancing Tuesday.\nAnother 31 counties were still in the orange stage, and three — Del Norte, Yuba and Shasta, all in rural Northern California — remained in the red tier.\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t"
